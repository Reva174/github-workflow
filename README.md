# github-workflow
## *1. Project Scope*
The main goal for our team this sprint is to build a simple but working game application that users can play and get instant feedback with their scores. We want to ensure the game logic is fully functional and that we have a clean, easy-to-use interface.
*Key features:*
*-* Game logic that allows smooth gameplay.
*-* Basic UI with start, play, and end screens.
*-* A score-tracking system.
*-* Clear instructions for the user.
*Out of scope for now:*
*-* Advanced styling and animations.
*-* User login and database setup.
*-* Deployment to production.

## *2. Milestones and Timeline*
We have aligned our timeline with upcoming sessions:
*-* By “Game structure with Copilot”: We aim to map out the game logic and structure, deciding on the main functions and flow.
*-* By “Mid-sprint demo + feedback”: We plan to have a working prototype ready that can be tested and shown for initial feedback.
*-* End of sprint: We want to fix any bugs from the demo, polish the UI, and complete internal testing.

## *3. Team Roles and Responsibilities*
*(A) Reva (me):*
*-* Writing and refining the game functions.
*-* Checking that the code is clear and readable.
*-* Taking notes during testing to track what needs improvement.
*(B) Shivam:*
*-* Creating the basic UI screens for the game.
*-* Helping test the game flow.
*-* Managing any merge conflicts during development.
*(C) Naman:*
*-* Implementing the game logic using Copilot.
*-* Managing Trello to track our tasks.
*-* Preparing for the mid-sprint demo.
*Our roles will stay the same for this sprint to keep things clear, but we will help each other if someone gets stuck.*
*Coordination:*
We will have short daily standups on Discord, use GitHub issues for tracking bugs, and check in weekly to ensure we are on track.

## *4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies*
*(A) Possible challenges:*
*-* Handling merge conflicts when combining our code.
*-* Differences in coding styles.
*-* Managing Copilot suggestions without becoming too dependent.
*-* Balancing sprint work with our other academic tasks.
*(B) Strategies to manage them:*
*-* Use feature branches with clear commit messages to avoid conflicts.
*-* Do pair programming to align coding practices.
*-* Review and test Copilot’s suggestions thoroughly.
*-* Keep our daily standups consistent to track progress and blockers.
